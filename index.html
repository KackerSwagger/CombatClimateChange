            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges facing humanity comes from how
                 we interact with our environment. Society, as it stands 
                 today, does not have a sustainable future with our ever 
                 increasing pressure on Earth’s resources and altercation of 
                 the environment. Climate change is among the most conerning issues
                and this site aims to break down the facts, address misconceptions,
                and explore the highest impact solutions. </p>

            <h2>The Scale of Our Emissions</h2>
            <p>With the impending climate crisis, it is important to investigate which 
            nationstates and economic sectors emit the most GHGs (greenhouse gases). By 
            being able to pinpoint where most pollution originates from, we can prioritize 
            which sources to address and create a strategy that could fully encompass the 
            multifaceted nature of the problem. There are many different sources of GHGs and 
            it is important to identify which ones are the most polluting so that we could use 
            our time and resources effectively to prevent a rapid change in our global 
            temperatures. </p>
            <p>
                There are many different scales that could be used to identify GHGs emission 
                sources. On the larger end of the scale, we have emissions by nationstates. 
                There are two measurements that are useful, which are the total emissions per 
                year, and the historical emissions the country has emitted since fossil fuels 
                have been utilized. At this scale, it is useful in identifying which nations 
                bear responsibility in reducing GHG emissions, but this is a tricky discussion 
                beyond the scope of this article (see geopolitical solutions for further discussion).
            </p>
            <p>
                On another scale are emissions by the economic sector or the economic activities 
                that lead to the production of GHGs. There is variation by how the economic sectors
                are categorized and which polluting processes are included, but generally the major 
                sectors are: Electricity, Industry, agriculture, land-use change and forestry, 
                buildings, transportation, and waste.

            <p id= "imageCaption2">Here is a more detailed example:</p>
            <img id="bigPicture" src="resources/Emissions-by-sector-–-pie-charts.png"/>
            <p>Global greenhouse gas emissions by sector gives us a holistic view as to where the 
                major sources are found within our international economy. For policymakers however, 
                it would be more useful to work with emissions by sector within the nation. Due to 
                specialization within the global economy, some nations may find their emissions to be 
                dominated by the industry sector like <a href ="https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Indonesia-CT-2020-WEB.pdf">Indonesia</a>
                whereas other countries like the <a href ="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">USA</a>
                have the majority of their emissions coming from transport (see Countries of interest for a profile on each nation’s
                emissions). The production of emissions in most nations however comes from the electricity and heat production sector 
                specifically from burning fossil fuels. Among the highest emitting nations, a common trend is that emissions mostly stem 
                from electricity and heat production as the demand of energy is high, either for the general population’s lifestyle or for 
                manufacturing purposes. The energy demand is met through the burning of fossil fuels but with coal being especially prevalent 
                in China and India (see Countries of Interest). <a href = "https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/how-much-carbon-dioxide-produced-when-different-fuels-are-burned">coal</a> 
                releases the most CO2 per thermal unit of energy when burned compared to other fossil fuels. 
            </p>
            <p>More recently, the sources of GHGs can be viewed from individual companies rather than nationally. Based on the 
            <a href="https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240">carbon majors</a>
            report, 100 companies accounted for 71% of global cumulative emissions from 1988-2015. Of the 100 companies included, 41 public investor-owned companies, 16 private investor-owned companies, 36 
            state-owned companies, and 7 state producers. It is important to note that the study used both scope 1 and scope 3 emissions in its calculation with scope 3 emissions accounting for 90% of a 
            company’s total emissions. This is an important note because a larger portion of scope 3 emissions can come from the consumer. Scope 1 emissions are generally emissions that are produced onsite 
            and from the organization's vehicles. Scope 3 emissions can be broken down further into two categories, upstream and downstream emissions. Upstream processes occur before the production of the 
            good and service and can include emissions from material acquisition and preprocessing. Downstream occurs after the good is produced, and processes usually account for the majority of scope 3 
            emissions. Its sources can include emissions from the distribution and storage of goods, consumer use (like gasoline in a car), and end-of-life disposal. See more on emission scopes
            <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance">here</a>
            </p>
            <p>GHG emissions from nations, economic sectors, companies, and individuals are all various scales that could be used to determine where the majority of emissions originate from. Consequently, 
            knowing the origin can help assign responsibility on reducing these emissions as well as giving us strategic points to attack for maximum impact. For example, understanding that a large proportion
            of GHGs comes from the burning of coal in many of the top polluting countries should give us a major incentive to decommission coal-fired power plants and use alternatives that are ideally renewable.
            While it may seem as though individuals have a minimal impact on emissions, it is individuals that make up our world and therefore it is our responsibility to preserve it. As individuals, we’ve formed 
            collectives in the face of danger and oppression and we must all do our part to preserve this planet. (see personal action on what you could do).</p>
